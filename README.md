Mapping the West Nile Virus in New York City
A mapping project by Team Data Idol
We mapped West Nile Virus incidences for New York over the past five years by zipcode. 
Each color, ranging from pale yellow through to crimson, represents an increasing number of inicidence levels in each affected zipcode.
We then used the 2012 maps, and looked at the average household income level in each zipcode and then highlighted where there was a record of West Nile Virus in 2012. We did the same for population density levels.
In these maps, we were looking for any correlation between economic circumstances and population density with West Nile Virus.

At the end of a 2 day effort, here's what we came up with : 

A timeline of incidents in New York City
Correlations between different economic and demographic indicators with incidents of the West Nile Virus
Datasets 

Demographic and household income data by NYC zipcode.
Incident reports and surveillance of West Nile Virus in NYC.
Shape data for NYC based on zipcodes
